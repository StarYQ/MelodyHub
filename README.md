Using Next.js and the Spotify API, develop a web application that tracks users' listening history to generate fun, readable statistics. Users can also connect with friends to compare stats or form groups to view shared, group-based statistics. Via LLM integration, there will also be an option for users to inquire or converse about their stats through an AI chatbot feature.
